### Notes

This repository is my personal GenAI learning space.
It contains everything I am studying and practicing:

* Daily progress
* Topic-wise notes
* Clean and commented code examples
* Practical agent building (tools, memory, structured outputs)
* RAG, streaming, observability, input/output guards
* Multi-agent systems
* Experiments, tests, revisions

This repo will grow continuously.
**Corrections, improvements, and new concepts will be added as I progress.**
